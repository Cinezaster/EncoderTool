## Flavours
Rotary encoders come in a lot of flavours. 

1) **Manually operated mechanical encoders**\
They are often used as setpoint devices to replace potentiometers or to select menu entries and similar applications. They come with or without mechanical detents. 

2) **Manually operated optical or magnetic encoders**\
There are also encoders for high end panel or setpoint applications based on optical or mechanical sensors. As the cheap ones you can get them with or without mechanical detents (see e.g. [here](https://www.megatron.de/en/category/rotary-encoders.htm) for some examples).

2) **High resolution encoders**\
Those always use optical or magnetic sensors and are typically used for positioning applications, in CNC machines, to measure rotational speed of motors or scientific applications. Versions with 500'000'000 positions per revolutions are readily available. (e.g. https://www.heidenhain.de/de_EN/products/angle-encoders/modular-angle-encoders-with-optical-scanning/eca-4000/). Due to the high pulse frequency such encoders are typically read out by specialized hardware counters.
