# Encoder Types

*Rotary encoders come in a lot of flavors.*

<br>

## Manual + Mechanical

Often used as set - point devices to replace potentiometers, <br>
select menu entries and other similar applications.

They come with or without mechanical detents. 

<br>

## Manual + Optical / Magnetic

Used for high-end panel or set - point applications.

They come with or without mechanical detents.

## High Resolution

Those always use optical or magnetic sensors and are typically used for positioning applications, in CNC machines, to measure rotational speed of motors or scientific applications. Versions with 500'000'000 positions per revolutions are readily available. (e.g. https://www.heidenhain.de/de_EN/products/angle-encoders/modular-angle-encoders-with-optical-scanning/eca-4000/). Due to the high pulse frequency such encoders are typically read out by specialized hardware counters.
