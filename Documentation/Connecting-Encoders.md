Encoders can be connected as shown in the image above. I.e., you connect the two phases A and B to some digital input and the common encoder pin to either GND or VCC. Make sure to use VCC = 3.3V for T-3.6 and T4.x. The T3.2 and T3.5 can tolerate up to 5V.

Usually, you don't need the external pull up/down resistors. You can use the built in ones instead.
